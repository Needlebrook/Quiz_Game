# Quiz Game

A simple but fun console-based quiz game written in C. ❓

5 General Knowledge questions are asked and you have to answer with a, b, c, or d. (case insensitive) 🧠

One point is awarded for every correct answer. But don't worry if you get something wrong. We'll just move on. ⭐

Points are tallied up and announced at the end. 🏆 

Hope you have fun! 🥳
